# Student Grade Predictor

A Python-based machine learning app that predicts students' grades—or performance levels—based on past academic data and input features.

## Features
- Predicts future grades using a trained ML model.
- Simple and beginner-friendly interface (CLI or web interface, if available).
- Includes scripts for both training and inference.
